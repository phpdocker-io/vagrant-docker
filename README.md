# Vagrant docker box [wip]

Since docker desktop is becoming a paid-for product for business users on Mac and PC, this
vm is being designed as an easy way to load a bunch of services within a Vagrant box and 
expose them externally.

This is still a work in progress.

## Requirements
 - Ansible 2
 - Vagrant 2.2
 - Virtualbox
